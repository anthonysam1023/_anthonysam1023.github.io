 <h1>Cats</h1>   
<img src=catss.jfif alt="Cat">
 <p>Cats are great because they are willing not to like you unless you givethem food. Dogs only like you so that you will give them food. Cats are more honest than dogs in this way. Cats are bug killers for your home and dogs dont do anything except ask you to play with them. Cats don't need attention, just food. Dogs are like actually owning an animal where as a cat in a interactive house plant.</p>
